 Arguably one of the most colorful wings in the campus, the C-Top-Mid Azad continues to live upto its reputation.
 The wing which lives above ours would tell you of our strange habits because the smoke always rises up! 
The variety you see in our wing is quite unparalleled. The wing is made up of fifth years right now. 
From a WTMS god guitarist to a 3-time Europe-FT champion, from Finance Signal Specialist to the fiercest G.Sec Soc-Cult in the campus. 
From a revered film-maker to an electric geek with IR < 5. The best-actor-turned-hermit, a relentless archi enthusiast,
 a counter-striker-turned-lover, the fine-arts panda architect, a well-read English vocab God, 
a married (nearly) electronics entrepreneur and a weight-lifting US-lover. We have it all!
And as they say, variety is the spice of life. Living together in Azad since our very first year, we look forward to the life ahead.
