						<h2>We have 11 good reasons of "Why should you attend the Meet?"</h2></br></br>
<p align="justify">The 11<sup>th</sup> Annual Alumni Meet from 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> January,  2014 the time for which most of you were eagerly 
waiting,  to re-live your past, to re-explore your alma mater, to have a reunion of your colleagues, to share your experiences after college life,  is
						now anxiously awaiting your arrival.</br><p></br>
<ol>
<li>Release yourself from the complexities of the present,  immerse yourself into the past,  re-discover your
alma mater and renew friendships as you take a trip down memory lane to relive the most cherished
years of your life when everything was possible. The Meet is a real time platform for you people
to rekindle your old interests,  revive your past memories,  and bring them back from walled scenic
memories to the truth of the present.</br></li></br>
<li>Days come and go. But the most important thing is to cherish your human connections,  your
relationships with friends and colleagues. The Meet gives you the chance to re-connect with your old
friends and share your experiences after college life. </br></li></br>
<li>The Meet offers you the chance to re-visit your hallowed Hall of Residence,  your abode in Kgp where
it all seemed like a family. Helping your juniors,  making fun of seniors and taking advice from them
too,  last day exam preparations,  continuous night-outs for Illumination and Rangoli,  tempo shouts after
winning in any event,  the spirit of General Championship that was more important than exams even,  all
that sento which made it a 'HALL' and never a hostel. The time has come to feel that zeal once again in your
hearts.</br></li></br></ol>

off your feet. The Meet is a chance for you to witness the improvement in facilities in the recent years, 
like renovation of the Old Gymkhana,  construction of new labs,  classrooms,  etc.</br> </li></br></br>
<li>Revisiting your Department is one of the things you will enjoy the most. The classes you bunked,  the
scolding from the professors,  those warnings of deregistration,  all those memories are preserved in
those buildings,  waiting for you to reopen the chambers.</br></li></br></br>
<li>A time to check in and see,  whether your favorite hang-out spots,  may be parks,  grounds,  canteens or
restaurants still exist. Or what has replaced them. A chance to tell your family members,  "Oh! I have
been here."</br></li></br></br>
